### Project Description
LinkedIn Lie Detector â€” The world absolutely didnâ€™t ask for this, but here it is: an AI that judges how fake your humblebrag LinkedIn post sounds, rewrites it so you sound like a human, adds sarcastic or polite comments, and pretends youâ€™re a 5M-follower influencer. 

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Zero Feelings Meter** â€“ Detect the % of AI involvement in any LinkedIn post.
- **Human Rewrite** â€“ Make your post sound like a real person wrote it.
- **Brutally Honest Comments** â€“ Auto-generate short, straight-to-the-point roasts.
- **Post Drama Mode** â€“ Rewrite your brag into a chaotic, sleep-deprived story.
- **Influencer Simulator** â€“ Pretend you have 5M followers with fake likes, comments, and reposts.

## ðŸ¤¡ The Problem (that doesnâ€™t exist)
People post on LinkedIn with excessive gratitude, hashtags, and corporate buzzwords â€” but little to no actual detail. Itâ€™s impossible to tell if theyâ€™re genuinely happy or just feeding the algorithm.

## ðŸ›  The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A machine-learning-powered **Lie Detector** that:
1. Scores your sincerity
2. Roasts you in the comments
3. Rewrites your brag into a relatable story
4. Fakes social media clout for pure vanity
